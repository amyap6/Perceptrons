# Perceptrons
Three implementations of linear perceptrons including an ensemble, with tools for classifier evaluation.

LinearPerceptron, EnhancedLinearPerceptron and LinearPerceptronEnsemble can all be run independently.
EvaluationTools is a helper class used to evaluate these linear perceptrons against each other.
